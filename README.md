# Michael Widener II's – Widener Web Service

You found my Wwb Service. From here, I make websites, software, animation, graphic designs, and anything that lives in a digital form. I work exclusively indoors, never outdoors, and I'm an expert. I look forward to working on your project. All projects follow best practices in technology service. All projects require a half-down payment to being and full payment before any digital work is available to transfer to the client's (your) possession. This is standard practice in technololgy / knowledge work, otherwise known as Intellectual Property Work, or Thought Work. There are no exceptions. We do not offer special rates for any reason. All rates are universal. All prices will eventually be listed. I believe in showing exactly what costs will be before beginning work.
