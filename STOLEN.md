Any attempt to steal, mimic, derive from, or commercially exploit these works—especially by entities that:

Verification is the burden of the accused.

If you operate a website that does business in the United States and fail to prove your lawful standing, you **will be presumed to be an unlawful entity** operating in bad faith. Dereliction of transparency is a violation of modern digital norms. The Internet was invented in the United States and will be policed accordingly.

**I will prosecute violations in any jurisdiction that permits U.S.-based intellectual property enforcement.**
